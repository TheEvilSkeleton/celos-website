                    CelOS is an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution that puts 3 main philosophies into practice! Beautiful design, security and ease of use!
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Beautiful design:</b><br>
                    We aim to have a stunning design, by using the GNOME desktop enviroment and stunning animations, complete with some GNOME extensions and our own "Fluent" theme, we plan to have a beautiful and easy to use desktop.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Security:</b><br>
                    We aim to be as secure as possible. Most preinstalled applications come from Flatpak and flathub, a containerised, sandboxed method of Linux application distribution.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Ease of use:</b><br>
                    We aim to be a distribution for the majority of people, those who want a beautiful, stable and secure desktop. Flatpak is at the heart of CelOS. The core applications you may be using eg: Firefox, will come from a flathub repository. Any software or games you might want to install (examples include: spotify, discord, steam, minecraft) can be installed right from the terminal with one command! Go here <a href="flatpak.html">to learn about how you can use flatpak.</a>
                </p>
               
                <p>
                    We believe that open-source software is the way forward; it brings in positive change to the developing community, as well as aspiring new developers to try their hand in the computing scene. Which is why, like every other Cob:web project, we are allowing open contributions to CelOS, from any user, from any background.
                </p>
